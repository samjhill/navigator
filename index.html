                <p>Our Business Valuation Training Program is a 2-day intensive workshop (8 hours total) that gives you the skills you need to start a career in finance. We've designed it to be practical, hands-on, and immediately useful.</p>
                <p>You'll learn the main valuation methods like DCF, comparables, and precedent transactions. We also cover financial modeling and how to read financial statements. Everything we teach connects theory with real-world practice, so you can actually use what you learn.</p>
                <p>We don't just focus on the technical stuff. You'll also learn about industry trends, how to grow your career, and ways to build your professional network. Through real case studies, you'll practice valuing companies and see how different approaches work in different situations.</p>
                <p>Whether you're completely new to finance or already have some experience, this program works for you. We cover the basics at the start, so everyone can follow along. If you're already familiar with some concepts, you'll still get a lot out of the advanced techniques and real-world applications.</p>

                        <li><strong>Valuation Framework</strong> - We'll cover the three main ways to value a company: DCF, comparables, and precedent transactions. You'll learn how to build these models and, just as importantly, how to understand what they're telling you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Income Approach: DCF Analysis</strong> - We'll walk through DCF analysis step by step. You'll learn how to estimate future earnings, project cash flows, and bring everything back to present value. It sounds complicated, but we'll make it clear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Market Approach: Comparables</strong> - You'll learn how to find the right companies to compare against, understand market trends, and apply the right multiples. This is how most real-world valuations actually work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Synthesizing Value</strong> - Here's where it all comes together. You'll learn how to combine different valuation methods to get a complete picture. We'll also cover how to adjust for things like non-operating assets and other factors that can throw off your numbers.</li>

                        <li><strong>Real-World Case Studies</strong> - We'll look at actual valuations and real deals. You'll see what worked, what didn't, and why. This is where theory meets practice, and you'll get to work through scenarios you'll actually face on the job.</li>
                        <li><strong>Career Development & Networking</strong> - We'll talk about how to build your network in the valuation world. We'll also cover certifications like the CFA and ASA, and how they can help your career grow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mastering Technical Interviews</strong> - Interviewing for valuation roles can be tough. We'll practice answering technical questions and help you develop the communication skills that make great candidates stand out.</li>
